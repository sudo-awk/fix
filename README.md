You can run this script to automate python application not installed in reconftw installation scriptt, 

https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw.git

After running the ./install script in reconftw I got multiple apps not installed.


```
 [*] xnLinkFinder               [NO]        
 [*] waymore            [NO]
 [*] dnsvalidator               [NO]                                                                     
 [*] metafinder                 [NO]                                                                     
 [*] interlace                  [NO]

You can run the script to install them in pipx environment, just download the `.sh` file and make them executeable

```
chmod +x fix.sh | bash
```

Special thanks to six2dez for making this awesome tool.
